    "# Handle Missing Data\n",
    "In this section, we will see how the handling of missing data will affect performance. We will do a quick spot-checking, that is to create a baseline model with fast-running algorithm, then compare its performance with and without preprocessing missing data as explained above.\n",

    "The data will be tested with DecisionTree algorithm, and it will be cross-validated with 10-kfold splits. We won't do any grid search at this step as we only want to see if missing data handling works."
